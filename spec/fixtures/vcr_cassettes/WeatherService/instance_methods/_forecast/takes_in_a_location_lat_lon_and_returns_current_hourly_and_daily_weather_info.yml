        DAY FOR PARTICULATES FROM 400 PM SUNDAY UNTIL 400 PM\nMONDAY...\nThe Colorado
        Department of Public Health and Environment has\nissued the following...\nWHAT...Action
        Day for Particulates.\nWHERE...Douglas, Jefferson, Denver, western Arapahoe,
        western\nAdams, Broomfield, Boulder, Larimer, and Weld Counties\nWHEN...400
        PM Sunday September 27 to 400 PM Monday September 28\nIMPACTS...Action Day
        for Particulates is now in effect for the\nseven-county Denver-Boulder metropolitan
        area. Requests to limit\ndriving of non- ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or diesel)
        are now in\neffect until at least 4 PM Monday, September 28, 2020.  Decreased\nactivity
        at local wildfires has resulted in much improved air\nquality for most of
        the Front Range region. However, parts of\ncentral and western Larimer and
        Boulder Counties could still see\nperiods of brief to heavy smoke through
        Monday afternoon due to\ntheir proximity to the Mullen and Cameron Peak wildfires.  For\nareas
        included in this advisory that are not expected to exceed\nthe Unhealthy for
        Sensitive Groups (USG) air quality designation,\nwe request that activities,
        such as driving non- ZEV vehicles\n(i.e., gas or diesel), be reduced to lessen
        the impacts on\nneighboring air quality. Additional air pollution in this
        region\nmay directly worsen air quality or contribute to precursors which\nmay
        also adversely affect air quality.  For Colorado air quality\nconditions,
        forecasts and advisories, visit:\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/airquality/colorado_summary.aspx\nHEALTH
        INFORMATION...If smoke is thick or becomes thick in your\nneighborhood you
        may want to remain indoors. This is especially\ntrue for those with heart
        disease, respiratory illnesses, the very\nyoung, and the elderly. Consider
        limiting outdoor activity when\nmoderate to heavy smoke is present. Consider
        relocating\ntemporarily if smoke is present indoors and is making you ill.
        If\nvisibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in your neighborhood,\nsmoke
        has reached levels that are unhealthy."}]}'
